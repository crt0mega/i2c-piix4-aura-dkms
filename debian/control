Description: OpenRGB kernel patch includes the i2c-piix4 kernel driver,
 patched to enable a second SMBUS controller on AMD AM4 chipsets (see
 Bug 202587 at Kernel.org Bugzilla), as well as the i2c-nct6775 kernel
 driver which provides access to Nuvoton Super-IO chips' SMBus
 controllers. This package provides a patched module ready for DKMS as
 well as some helper files found at Archlinux' AUR.
